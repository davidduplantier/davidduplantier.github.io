    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>A friend once complained while completing a tedious programming assignment, "I shouldn't have to reinvent this if there's already
    an accepted solution!" While he was only half-joking and well aware of the benefits of learning to program foundational algorithms
    from scratch, entertaining his complaint leads us to an interesting observation of how computer programmers as a whole violate one
    of the simplest rules for good software design, namely the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
    </p>
    <p>The DRY principle advises that identical code used in different places should be rewritten in a single unit (such as a function), in
    order that changes to the code are confined to one place. This makes it much easier to maintain software as it evolves. Returning
    to the friend's complaint, what about identical code rewritten by different programmers in various projects? Could this be considered
    a higher-level violation of the DRY principle, because software professionals are needlessly spending time writing the same code over
    and over again and making the same mistakes?
    </p>
    <p>That this hypothesized violation of DRY is not superfluous is evidenced by the predominant use of StackOverflow to search for
    solutions to common questions among programmers. In other words, StackOverflow answers form a database of solutions so that programmers
    do not have to reinvent everything from scratch. This possibly suggests that code snippets from highly upvoted answers this code are
    widely used throughout codebases in the real world. If programmers can agree that a specific solution is the best one for a specific use
    case, why not have a code generation tool that automatically fills in the accepted solution?
    </p>
    <p>What would usage for such a tool look like? Imagine a web developer is working with an instance of a Map object with variable name
    map, and wishes to iterate through map and add 5 to each value. Perhaps she could
    simply write something like:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    ITERATE map ADD 5
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>which subsequently generates the JavaScript code, where the previous high level description is interpreted as:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    [Action on Object] [Object] [Action on Element] [Action on Element Argument]
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>There might be a database of actions to select from, and if one does not exist, it can be added by manually coding it and giving it
    a name. Furthermore, this high level language need not be specific to a single language, but be capable of translating the same specification
    into different programming languages. For example, the above iteration through a map could be translated into JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.
    which all possess Map objects.

    <h5>Update</h5>
    <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133908">Here</a> is a software engineering research article that maps code duplication on GitHub.
    The authors acknowledge a broad variety of ways in which code duplication occurs, including copy/pasted StackOverflow snippets. Their main
    contribution is a series of heat flow charts that map the percentage of code duplication in GitHub repositories for different programming
    languages. For example, the authors found that JavaScript projects had the highest duplication rate, whereas Java projects had the least
    duplication.</p>
